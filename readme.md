# ðŸ“œ Meeting Minutes Generator

## Overview
This is a Streamlit-based web application that processes audio recordings of meetings and generates structured minutes. The app transcribes speech using OpenAI's Whisper model, performs speaker diarization with Gemini AI, summarizes key points, analyzes sentiment, extracts keywords, and detects action items. The final minutes can be downloaded as a Word document.

## Features
- **Speech-to-Text Transcription**: Converts audio recordings into text using Whisper.
- **Speaker Diarization**: Identifies different speakers using the Gemini AI model.
- **Summarization**: Generates a concise summary of the meeting.
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Classifies the meeting tone as Positive, Negative, or Neutral.
- **Keyword Extraction**: Identifies the most relevant keywords from the meeting.
- **Action Item Detection**: Extracts actionable points from the discussion.
- **Download as Word Document**: Saves the meeting minutes as a `.docx` file.
